            <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures
                and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic
                typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid
                application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>

            <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form
                for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>,
                and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free
                third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>

            <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or
                other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable
                applications.</p>

            <h3>? Nonrestrictive Programming Syntax</h3>
            <p>
                Python is the language that even a non-programmer can understand. It is a highly readable,
                problem-oriented language that lets you focus on writing the logic instead of getting into the syntax
                nitty-gritty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a sample program for implementing an Interest Calculator. By looking at it, you can feel how
                easy it is to write and understand the code in Python.</p>
            <code>
print('Interest Calculator:')
       <br><br>
amount = float(input('Principal amount ?'))<br>
roi = float(input('Rate of Interest ?'))<br>
yrs = int(input('Duration (no. of years) ?'))<br>
<br>
total = (amount * pow(1 + (roi/100), yrs))<br>
interest = total - amount<br>
print('\nInterest = %0.2f' %interest)</code>

            <h3>? No Explicit Declaration</h3>
            <p>In Python, don’t use type specifier for declaring variables. You can do so without mentioning any data
                types in Python. Also, there is no need to use any separator like a semicolon to mark the end of a
                statement.</p>

            <p>In Python, indentation replaces brackets to group a block of instructions. And you can use either tabs
                or spaces to indent the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Python enforces some rules (PEP 8) such as to use four spaces per indentation level. So, there
                are many such facets in Python which make learning simpler for beginners.</p>
            <h3>? Case Sensitive Programming</h3>
            <p>A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An
                identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters,
                underscores and digits (0 to 9).</p>
            <p>

                Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case
                sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Creating Strings</li>
            </h3>
            <p> Creating Strings is easy, and it is done simply by enclosing the characters in single or double quotes.
                The strings in Python consider both single and double quotes as the same. In the following example, we
                are providing the different ways for initializing strings and showcasing the use of Python string
                replace function.</p>

            <p>Just to share an important note that you can also use triple quotes to create strings. However,
                programmers use them to mark multi-line strings and docstrings.</p>
            <br />
            <code>

       <sub># Python string examples - all assignments are identical.</sub><br/>
       <p>String_var = 'Python'</p>
       <p>String_var = "Python"</p>
       <p>String_var = """Python"""</p>
<sub>
  # with Triple quotes Strings can extend to multiple lines</sub>
       <p>
         String_var = """
 This document will help you to
explore all the concepts
of Python Strings!!! """</p>
    
<sub>
  # Replace "document" with "tutorial" and store in another variable</sub><p>
       substr_var = String_var.replace("document", "tutorial")</p>
       <p>
         print (substr_var)</p>
     </code>
            <h3>
                <li>Declaring variables</li>
            </h3>
            <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a
                variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>
            <p>The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

                The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of
                the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example:</p>
            <code><p>counter = 100         <em> #An integer assignment</em></p>
       <p>miles   = 1000.0       <em>#A floating point</em></p>
       <p>name    = "John"      <em> #A string</em></p>

<p>print counter<br/>
print miles<br/>
  print name</p></code>
            <h3>
                <li>Creating Numbers</li>
            </h3>
            <p>Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For
                example:</p>
            <code>var1 = 1 <br/>
var2 = 10</code>
            <p>Python supports four different numerical types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    int (signed integers);</li>
                <li>
                    long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal);</li>
                <li>
                    float (floating point real values);</li>
                <li>
                    complex (complex numbers).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                <li>Creating Lists</li>
            </h3>
            <p>Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas
                and enclosed within square brackets ([]).</p>
            <p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting
                at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (+) sign is the list
                concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example:</p>
            <code>list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]<br/>
tinylist = [123, 'john']<br/>

       <p>print list          <em> #Prints complete list</em></p>
       <p>print list[0]      <em > #Prints first element of the list</em></p>
       <p>print list[1:3]     <em> #Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd</em> </p>
       <p>print list[2:]       <em> #Prints elements starting from 3rd element</em></p>
       <p>print tinylist * 2   <em> #Prints list two times</em></p>
       <p>print list + tinylist <em> #Prints concatenated lists</em></p></code>

                <h1>Loops</h1>
            </header>

            <p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first,
                followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code
                several number of times.</p>
                
                    <h3><li>While Loop</li></h3>
                
                <p>A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.</p>
                <p>A key point of the while loop is that the loop might not ever run. When the condition is tested and the result is false, the loop body will be skipped and the first statement after the while loop will be executed.</p>
                <code>count = 0 <br/>
                    while (count < 9):<br/>
                       print 'The count is:', count<br/>
                       count = count + 1<br/>
                    
                    print "Good bye!"</code>

                    <p>The above produces the following result:</p>
<code>
The count is: 0 <br/>
The count is: 1 <br>
The count is: 2 <br>
The count is: 3 <br>
The count is: 4 <br>
The count is: 5 <br>
The count is: 6 <br>
The count is: 7 <br>
The count is: 8 <br>
Good bye!
</code>
          <h3><li>If-Elif-Else Loop</li></h3>
<p>An else statement can be combined with an if statement. An else statement contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<code>
    var1 = 100 <br>
if var1:
   print "1 - Got a true expression value"<br>
   print var1 <br>
else:
   print "1 - Got a false expression value"<br>
   print var1
<br>
var2 = 0 <br>
if var2:
   print "2 - Got a true expression value"<br>
   print var2
   <br>
else:
   print "2 - Got a false expression value"<br>
   print var2
<br>
print "Good bye!"
